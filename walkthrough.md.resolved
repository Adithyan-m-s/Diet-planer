# Walkthrough - Fat Loss Diet Plan Creator

I have built a modern, clean, and fully functional web application for creating Kerala-style fat loss diet plans.

## Features
- **Personalized Calculations**: Uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate BMR and TEE based on age, weight, height, and activity level.
- **Goal-Oriented**: Adjusts calorie targets based on the user's preferred fat loss speed (0.25kg, 0.5kg, or 1kg per week).
- **Kerala Cuisine Focus**: Generates a 7-day meal plan featuring popular Kerala dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- **Glassmorphic Design**: A premium, modern UI with floating cards, background animations, and responsive layouts.
- **Privacy-First**: No login required; everything runs locally in the browser.

## Verification Results

- **UI Responsiveness**: The app is mobile-friendly with a flexible grid layout.
- **Functionality**: "Regenerate" and "Back to Inputs" buttons work seamlessly.
